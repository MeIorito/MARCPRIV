# MARC 3D Scanner electronics

## Wiring

The wires are the veins of the scanner. They lead to the brain (Raspberry Pi) of the scanner. And steer the muscles (motors). That means it is very important to wire MARC correctly, any definciencies could lead to MARC not working as well or at all. So work carefully!

  ## Scheme

  Here you can find the schematics for the wiring. If you follow this correctly you should be good. Make sure to first build the frame for the scanner, this way it is easier to know the length for everything.
  Make sure that when wiring the electronics you use extension cables for all the wires. These can be of any type, as long as they have room for four wires (Soldering is needed most of the time).
