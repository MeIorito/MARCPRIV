## Who are we?

We are 360fabriek, a company that specializes in VR/AR development. The goal of this project is to create a more affordible 3D scanning alternative. Wich resulted in MARC (Motorized Augmented Reality Capture). MARC uses a technique called photogrametry, 
this comes down to taking pictures from diffrent heights and angles. To automate this we made MARC, MARC is cheaper than outher 3D scanners and that is why this project is open-source. We want to make a change in the 3D world, and we hope that this helps lots of people with their 3D journey.
