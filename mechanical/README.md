# MARC 3D Scanner mechanical

The parts are the bones of the scanner. They give MARC its shape and make it able to move. That means it is very important to print and cut the parts correctly, any definciencies could lead to MARC not working as well or at all. So work carefully!
These are instructions, however this is not a step by step proces. We suspect that people who want to build this have some basic programming and engineering knowledge.
